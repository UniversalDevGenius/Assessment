Problem Statement:
You have been tasked with developing a system that can automatically generate image captions from a given input image. The system should leverage state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision and natural language processing to accurately describe the visual content of the image.
The specific requirements for the system are as follows:

Input: The system should accept an input image in a common format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
Object Detection: The system should be able to detect and identify various objects present in the input image using techniques like YOLO or other object detection models.
Scene Understanding: In addition to object detection, the system should be capable of understanding the overall scene or context depicted in the image, such as indoor/outdoor settings, activities, or events.
Caption Generation: Based on the detected objects and scene understanding, the system should generate a natural language caption that accurately and concisely describes the visual content of the image.
Language Model: The caption generation component should utilize a language model, such as a fine-tuned GPT or BERT model, to ensure grammatically correct and coherent captions.
Evaluation: Implement a mechanism to evaluate the quality of the generated captions, either through manual evaluation or by comparing against ground truth captions from a benchmark dataset.
Optimization: Explore techniques to optimize the system for real-time performance, considering factors like inference speed, memory footprint, and potential deployment on cloud platforms or edge devices.
Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation detailing the system architecture, techniques used, implementation details, and any relevant considerations or limitations.

Deliverables:

A working prototype of the image captioning system that meets the specified requirements.
Source code and any necessary data files or models.
A report documenting the system architecture, techniques used, implementation details, optimization strategies, evaluation results, and any relevant considerations or limitations.
A brief presentation or demo showcasing the capabilities of your system.

Evaluation Criteria:

Accuracy and quality of the generated image captions
Effectiveness of the object detection and scene understanding components
Appropriate use of state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision and natural language processing
Optimization strategies for real-time performance and potential deployment considerations
Code quality, documentation, and overall system design
Ability to communicate and present the project effectively
